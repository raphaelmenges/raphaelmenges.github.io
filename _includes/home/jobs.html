      <div class='abstract'>User-friendliness is fundamental for the success of Web applications. User studies
        help identify problems with Web sites. However, the evaluation of studies by usability experts is
        time-consuming, highly subjective and so difficult to understand that user studies are often skipped.
        Hence, many systems remain hard to use. We develop UDeco, a platform for a usability data ecosystem,
        that collects and processes usability data and knowledge from user studies in order to automate
        evaluation of usability studies by means of machine learning and data mining.</div>

      <div class='abstract'>The aim of the research project GazeMining is to capture Web sessions semantically and
        thus obtain a complete picture of visual content, perception and interaction. The log streams of
        usability tests are evaluated using data mining. The analysis and interpretability of the data collected
        in this way is made possible by a user-friendly presentation, semi-automatic and automatic analysis
        procedures.</div>

      <div class='abstract'>MAMEM's goal is to integrate these people back into society by increasing their
        potential for communication and exchange in leisure (e.g. social networks) and non-leisure context (e.g.
        workplace). In this direction, MAMEM delivers the technology to enable interface channels that can be
        controlled through eye-movements and mental commands. This is accomplished by extending the core API of
        current operating systems with advanced function calls, appropriate for accessing the signals captured
        by an eye-tracker, an EEGrecorder and bio-measurement sensors. Then, pattern recognition and tracking
        algorithms are employed to jointly translate these signals into meaningful control and enable a set of
        novel paradigms for multimodal interaction. These paradigms will allow for low- (e.g., move a mouse),
        meso- (e.g., tick a box) and high-level (e.g., select n-out-of-m items) control of interface
        applications through eyes and mind. A set of persuasive design principles together with profiles
        modeling the users (dis-)abilities will be also employed for designing adapted interfaces for disabled.
        MAMEM will engage three different cohorts of disabled (i.e. Parkinson's disease, muscular disorders, and
        tetraplegia) that will be asked to test a set of prototype applications dealing with multimedia
        authoring and management. MAMEM's final objective is to assess the impact of this technology in making
        these people more socially integrated by, for instance, becoming more active in sharing content through
        social networks and communicating with their friends and family.</div>
