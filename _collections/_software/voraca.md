Versatile tool to visualize volumes with GPU ray-casting. I have written the tool as part of my bachelor thesis. It allows to load abitrary volume data sets with density information. A transferfunction can be adjusted to map density values to color, opacity, and shading attributes like specular reflection. The ray-casting has been written as pixel shader and improved through stochastic jitterin, early ray termination, and empty space skipping.
