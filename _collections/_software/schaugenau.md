Schau genau! was designed for the State Horticultural Show Landau 2015 as arcarde box game, using only gaze and one buzzer as input. Nearly 3000 sessions were played during the summer without any downtime. I have used Java and the jMonkey engine as programming framework and Blender to create the assets.
