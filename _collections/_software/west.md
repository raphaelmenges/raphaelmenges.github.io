Homepage of the Institute for Web Science and Technologies at the University of Koblenz. The entire content is organized in a Git repository as markdown and HTML code. A push to the master branch triggers a continuous integration pipeline, which executes the Jekyll Page Generator within a Docker container and deploys the generated HTML pages to the Web server.
