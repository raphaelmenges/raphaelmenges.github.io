Final project for the course 'Realtime Rendering'. A polygonial scene is voxelized in real-time through geometry and pixel shading. The voxel grid is transferred to CUDA, where Voxel Cone Tracing is implemented to compute ambient occlusion and global illuminatin. My part of the project was the efficient voxelization of the scene.
