Total conversion for the game *Unreal Tournament 3* which was finalist in the last phase of *Make Something Unreal Content* for best first person modification in 2009. My parts in the project were the visuals and level design, Andre Taulien did the programming. No assets of the original game where used, so one may see it as indepenend game basing completely on our own ideas and art.
