Easy creation of user interfaces for real-time eye tracking input. One can define layouts in a XML manner and connect the elements via IDs with source code, that holds the logic. This enables fast prototyping with different layouts using the same source code as back-end. The library is written in C++11 and uses OpenGL 3.3 core profile for rendering.
