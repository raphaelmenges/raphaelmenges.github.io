Blender movie for the seminar *Aspekte der Bildgestaltung* in first semester of my studies. Two robots in a laboratory execute multiple experiments testing binocular perception. Arend Buchacher and I worked on it for over one year and it was presented at *CVTag* at University Koblenz-Landau in 2012. Soundtrack was produced by Michael Taenzer.
