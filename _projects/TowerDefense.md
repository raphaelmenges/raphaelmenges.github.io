My second bigger programming project, this time C++ in combination with fixed-pipeline OpenGL. I started that project after taking the lecture *Computer Graphics 1* to combine the main topics of that lecture in one project. It is a classic tower defense game with a build mode at day and an UFO invasion at night. There is a given grid where the towers may be placed and a preview of the path the UFOs will take. Most interesting was the use of breadth-first search, which helped me to calculate the path through the towers.
