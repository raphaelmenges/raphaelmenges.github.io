Mobile game for Windows (Phone) 8 by Andre Taulien, Michael Taenzer and me, released in 2014. It is a mini golf inspired game with litte creatures which the player must kick into lit holes. Most reviews are very positive and over 40.000 people downloaded the game to their computer, tablet or phone. I was responsible for the visuals and level design of the 21 levels. Development took 1.5 years but we are very proud of the final product.
