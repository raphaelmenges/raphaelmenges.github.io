Group project for a *Autodesk 3ds Max* introduction curse at university. It is about a lighthouse which job is to warn ships at night. So it has to sleep at day and stay up all night, but this day it is interrupted too often and find no sleep. Adrian Derstroff, Raphael Heidrich, Dominik Cremer, Saner Demirel and me worked for half a year on this project and presented it at *CV-Tag* in 2014 at University Koblenz-Lanau.
