Group project for a *Autodesk 3ds Max* course at university. It is about a lighthouse which job is to warn ships at night to avoid crashing the cliffs. So it has to sleep at day and stay up all night, but this day it is interrupted too often and finds no sleep. Adrian Derstroff, Raphael Heidrich, Dominik Cremer, Saner Demirel and me worked for half a year on this project and presented it successfully at *CV-Tag* in 2014 at University Koblenz-Lanau.
