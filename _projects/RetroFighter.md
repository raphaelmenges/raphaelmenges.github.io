My first C++ project utilizing sprite rendering of DirectX9 to render this simple top down scroller. One controls a small space ship with the mouse and has to avoid the asteroids coming from top. It was a very good training for understanding more complex data structures, connecting them to something bigger and debugging. Features like box based collision or animation were fun to implement.
