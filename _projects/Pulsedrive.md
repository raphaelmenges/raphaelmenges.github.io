This game is aimed to be a tech demo for the game engine *[w]tech* developed by Andre Taulien. All screenshots which can be found on IndieDB are rendered in realtime with his engine, but the game has been never released. But it was hell of a fun playing around with shaders, especially the sky of our map. There are multiple layers including clouds, moon and stars. In addition, a day and night cycle is implemented which makes the whole setting change within minutes.
