Eyetracking game mainly developed by Kevin Schmidt and me as part of their employement for the Institute for Web Science and Technologies at University Koblenz-Landau. It was designed for the State Horticultural Show Landau 2015 as arcarde box game, using only gaze and one buzzer as input. The development was started as group project for a reseach lab offered by *WeST* in 2013 but was not finished until end of semester. Therefore we both were employed to continue the work, to extend and refactor the code and prepare it to run standalone in an arcade box over a whole summer. In the final product, no code from the research lab's other members were left. Nearly 3000 sessions were played during that summer at Landau without any known issues. Powered by Java and jMonkey engine.
