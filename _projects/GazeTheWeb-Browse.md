Web browser controlled with gaze. Developed by as part of European project *MAMEM* at institute WeST by Dr. Chandan Kumar, Daniel MÃ¼ller and me. One can open URLs, scroll and navigate over hyperlinks to others URLs with gaze, no other input device is necessary. This projects is tightly coupled with *eyeGUI* since the complete rendering of the eye tracking interfaces is handled by the library. Web page rendering and interaction is done by Chromium Embedded Framework. For debugging purposes, mouse control is also implemented so feel free to give it a try.
